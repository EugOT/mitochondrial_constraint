# Code for mitochondrial constraint manuscript

This scripts in this repo were used to quantify constraint across the human mitochondrial genome, and to generate all data and figures presented in [our manuscript.](<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.16.520778v2>)

## Overview of repo:

`required_files`: input files for code.

`build_model`: code used to build the mitochondrial mutational model, and to curate of de novo mutations used to quantify mutability.

`calculate_oe`: code for assessment of mitochondrial constraint across functional variant classes and loci. 

`regional_constraint`: code used to identify regional constraint.

`local_constraint` code used to identify local constraint and generate the mitochondrial local constraint (MLC) score.

`other`: code for other analyses presented in the manuscript.

`figure_scripts`: scripts used for generating figures, video and datasets.


See the README in each directory for more information on contents.

The code was run using Python v3.10, R v3.6.1, and ChimeraX v1.3.
